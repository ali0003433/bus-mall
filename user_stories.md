1. As a Market Researcher, I would like valid data to be able to provide recommendations to the buyer. I want the app to account for common ways people can complete the task without actually providing helpful information. 
  a. User keeps their mouse in one spot and clicks on one location each time
  b. User goes too fast through the choices
  c. User doesn't understand how to select the product they want 
  d. User is not provided with any good options so they choose the best one, not one they'd actually purchase
  e. there's enough repetition to show that user is more likely to choose that image


2. As a focus group participant, I want to complete this survey quickly. I want as few directions to read as possible. I want to know how much more I have to complete and approximately how much time it might take me. I want to be in control of my pace and feel accomplishment as I progress. I want to know what the marketing team is learning about me. I would like to be able to view the results from a mathematical viewpoint. How do I match against the results of other focus group participants? I would like to know that tehy are using my time and attention for something purposeful. I want to be able to share feedback and ask questions. I want good quality images and an appealing website and user experience. 

3. As a developer, I want the site to be dynamic in case the client's needs change. I want to be able to do calculations on # of times shown and # of times clicked so I need them to be numbers. I want the code to be dry so it's straightforward to debug and edit. I want the code to have notes so if I need to make changes later or to come back to it, it's easier to pick back up. I want to console.log frequently so that I am able to monitor that the code is working. I want to create the functionality first and validate it with the client before I start styling.
